# EEG Data Analysis and Classification Toolkit

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for processing EEG data, extracting meaningful features, and training machine learning models for classification tasks. The toolkit is designed for multi-participant and multi-run EEG datasets, focusing on efficient preprocessing and robust analysis.

## Features
- Data Loading: Load EEG data from .gdf files for multiple participants and experimental runs.
- Feature Extraction: Extract features such as statistical measures, spectral properties, and event-related potentials from EEG data.
- Model Training: Train and evaluate machine learning models on extracted EEG features.
- Missing Value Handling: Identify and manage missing data in EEG recordings.
- Recording Analysis: Analyze the duration of EEG recordings and calculate dataset statistics.


## Dependencies 
- Python 3.8+
- MNE
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- PyPrep (for noisy channel detection)
- Matplotlib (for plotting and visualization)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
